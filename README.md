3. **Input a String**: Use the provided text box to enter a string you want to analyze.
4. **Watch the Animation**: Click "Run" to see the string processed through the automaton. You will see various states and transitions displayed visually.
5. **Explore Differences**: Use the comparison tool to see how a DFA and a PDA handle the same string.

## 🤔 Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, here are some common problems and solutions:

- **The application won't open**: Ensure you have the latest version of your web browser or install any required updates.
- **The interface is slow**: Close other applications to free up system resources.
- **Strings are not processed correctly**: Double-check your input for any typos or invalid characters.
